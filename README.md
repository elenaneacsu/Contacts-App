### Contacts App
A basic application developed for the *Java Masterclass Course* from Udemy which main purpose was to get familiar with JavaFX. The *loadContacts(), saveContacts(), saveContact()* and *createNode()* methods from the ContactData class have been provided from the start, since I/O concepts hadn't been covered at that specific time. 

The app allows the user to add a new contact, edit an existing one or delete it. The information about a contact is stored in an XML file. The fields do not contain validations of any kind.
